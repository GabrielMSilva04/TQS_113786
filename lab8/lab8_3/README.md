# Code Quality Issues Identified in Project Analysis

## Introduction

During static code analysis of our project with SonarQube, several code quality issues were identified. These issues range from potentially unsafe operations to maintainability concerns. This document outlines the key problems found and provides recommendations for addressing them.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Unsafe Optional Handling

**Issue**: `Call "Optional#isPresent()" or "!Optional#isEmpty()" before accessing the value.`

**Description**: The code accesses Optional values directly without checking if they exist, which can lead to NoSuchElementException at runtime.

### 2. String Literal Duplication

**Issue**: `Define a constant instead of duplicating this literal "from(bucket: "" 5 times.`

**Description**: The same string literal appears multiple times in the codebase, making maintenance difficult and error-prone.

### 3. Excessive Method Complexity

**Issue**: `Refactor this method to reduce its Cognitive Complexity from 22 to the 15 allowed.`

**Description**: A method in our codebase has become too complex, with too many decision points, nested conditions, and logical paths, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

### 4. Parameter Bloat in Constructor

**Issue**: `Constructor has 11 parameters, which is greater than 7 authorized.`

**Description**: A constructor in our codebase has too many parameters, which is a sign of poor class design and makes the class difficult to instantiate correctly.

### 5. Improper Logging

**Issue**: `Replace this use of System.out by a logger.`

**Description**: The code uses System.out.println() for logging instead of a proper logging framework.

## Conclusion

Addressing these code quality issues will significantly improve our codebase's maintainability, reliability, and readability. Most of these issues are straightforward to fix but will have a substantial positive impact on the project's overall quality. The team should prioritize these fixes in the next refactoring phase.
