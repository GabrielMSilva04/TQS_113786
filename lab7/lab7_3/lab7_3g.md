### Main Problems and Their Impacts:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - 7.5s**  
   - **Impact**: A high LCP indicates slow loading of the largest visible content, leading to poor user experience and higher bounce rates. It negatively affects SEO rankings as search engines prioritize fast-loading sites.
   
2. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - 0.581**  
   - **Impact**: A high CLS means significant layout shifts during page load, which frustrates users and can lead to accidental clicks. This also impacts SEO and user trust.

3. **Speed Index - 4.8s**  
   - **Impact**: A slow Speed Index reflects delayed visual content rendering, making the site feel sluggish to users.

4. **Performance Score - 40**  
   - **Impact**: A low overall performance score indicates poor optimization, which can reduce user engagement and conversion rates.

### Fixing Issues on a Long-Live Site:

- **Ease of Fixing**:  
   Fixing these issues on a live site can be challenging, especially if the codebase is outdated or poorly maintained. It may require significant refactoring, testing, and deployment efforts.


- **Steps to Fix**:
   - Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources.
   - Minimize render-blocking resources (e.g., CSS and JavaScript).
   - Improve server response times and caching strategies.

### Could This Be Avoided? How?

- **Prevention Strategies**:

   - **Regular Audits**: Conduct periodic performance audits using tools like Lighthouse to catch issues early.
   - **Responsive Design**: Use responsive and adaptive design principles to ensure smooth rendering across devices.
   - **Code Reviews**: Enforce best practices for performance during code reviews.
   - **Testing**: Test performance in staging environments before deploying changes to production.
